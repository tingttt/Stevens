Static HTML file 

Your page should have a few basic user interface elements:

A header tag, with an h1 naming your site, with a title for your page
A footer with your name, student ID, and any other info about yourself you wish to include
An empty unordered list with an id of characterList that is initially hidden.  
A div with an id of characterDetails that is initially hidden.
A form with an id of searchForm.
A text input with an id of search_term.
A label with a for attribute referencing your input
A button to submit the form (make sure this is a button element, not an input with type="submit")
A link that links back to the "/" route with the text "Back to All Characters" and that has an id 
of homeLink This link will initially be hidden. 
It will ONLY be displayed when the characterDetails element is being displayed or 
ONLY when a search is performed and search results are being displayed.  
You should NOT show this link on the initial character list.  
This link will simply trigger a reload of the page, which then will display the initial list of characters
